# Building with SharePoint Embedded

Below are two examples of apps with SharePoint Embedded. One is a client-side app using an Azure function and the other is a server-side app using C# and .NET. The source code and a walkthrough are provided for both applications. You are encouraged and recommended to start and build your app developments upon these boilerplate apps.

## [Server-side app](./syntex.rs-asp.net-webservice/)
